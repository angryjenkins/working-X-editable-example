Experimentation with x-editable
-------------------------------


Even though the repo hasn't been updated in two years, x-editable is still one of the best inline editing jQuery solutions.

I am trying to conform it to my needs. This sandbox will be where I handle issues such as:

+ finally work out custom fields.

+ pass unicode (fontawesome icon) and/or images into the select and checkbox options.
